# Tree of Math
Defining all of math programatically using set theory.

## Traits
 - Variable
   - An variable who's type is defined by the Axiomatic System used by the proof. The variable Trait simply counts up from 0 for each variable used in a proof.
 - Operator
   - A function defined by a proof, Linked to by a symbol.
 - Proposition
   - A series of quantizations and predicates
 - Proof
   - A proof is just a list of propositions that results in prooving a proposition from some axioms.
   - A proposition can be an Axiom, a Tautology, or a derived proposition.
   - Valid Proofs that use Valid Axioms in Dither can themselves be treated as Axioms because they link directly to other proofs. Full Proofs can be compiled by traversing the Tree of Math (much like compiling C++ into assembly)
